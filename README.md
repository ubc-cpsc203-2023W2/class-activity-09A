# Class Activity 9A - Fast Voronoi Art!

This class activity is intended to demonstrate:
- How to design and implement a more efficient algorithm for producing "Voronoi Art" (or "Voronoi blobification of actual art").
- How to use the Python `deque` collection to implement a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queue.

You can use this repository in one of two ways:
- You can clone it directly using the standard Git procedure.  In that case you **will not** be able to push your edits back up to this repository (you only have read access to this repository).
- You can copy this repository as a template in to your own GitHub account by following [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).  Using your own copy you can then push and pull as much as you like.  (We recommend that you make your own copy private so that other students won't confuse your repository with this one.)
